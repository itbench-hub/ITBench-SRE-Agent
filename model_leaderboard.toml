# Path to the ITBench scenarios directory
# Can point to:

# Number of runs per scenario (for statistical significance)

# Concurrency settings
# When concurrent=true, ALL experiments (scenarios × runs) run in parallel
# up to max_workers limit. Agents are still processed sequentially to see trends.
# Consider API rate limits when setting max_workers (typically 10-20 max).

# Judge Configuration
# ============================================================================
# The judge evaluates agent outputs against ground truth using litellm.
# Supports all litellm providers: OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, Google, LiteLLM proxy, etc.
#
# API key is read from environment based on provider:
#   - openrouter: OR_API_KEY or OPENROUTER_API_KEY
#   - openai: OPENAI_API_KEY
#   - azure: AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
#   - litellm_proxy: LITELLM_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY

# Agent Configurations
# ============================================================================
# Add agents to compare. Each agent runs on all scenarios.
#
# A run is uniquely identified by the combination of:
#   1. prompt   - prompt identifier (e.g., "tap", "fs_code")
#   2. commit   - git commit ID (auto-captured at runtime if not specified)
#   3. model    - model name
#
# Results are stored at: leaderboard_dir/{prompt}_{model}_{commit}/{scenario}/
#
# Required environment variables:
#   - OR_API_KEY: OpenRouter API key
#   - ETE_API_KEY: ETE LiteLLM Proxy API key
#   - AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY: Azure OpenAI API key
