# ITBench SRE Agent

**AI-Powered Site Reliability Engineering Agent**

## Overview

The ITBench SRE Agent is an open-source AI-powered Site Reliability Engineering agent that automates incident response in Kubernetes and OpenShift environments. Leveraging large language models and built on the CrewAI framework, this intelligent agent diagnoses complex system failures, traces root causes, and implements remediation strategies within real-world inspired incident scenarios on the ITBench platform.

### Key Features

- **Automated Incident Response**: Diagnose and resolve incidents in Kubernetes environments
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Works with ITBench's collection of realistic SRE incident scenarios
- **Observability Integration**: Integrates with Prometheus, Jaeger, and, Clickhouse
- **Containerized Execution**: Runs safely in containers to prevent harmful commands on host systems

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

### Running with Docker
The agent should always be run in a container in order to prevent harmful commands being run on the user's PC.

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IBM/ITBench-SRE-Agent
   cd ITBench-SRE-Agent
   ```

2. **Prepare your kubeconfig**
   
   Move the kubeconfig file from the cluster on which the ITBench is running into the root directory of this repo and rename it to `config`:
   ```bash
   mv /path/to/your/kubeconfig ./config
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   
   Move the provided `.env` file [here]() to the root directory of this repo.

4. **Build the container image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t itbench-sre-agent --no-cache .
   ```

5. **Run the agent**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   docker run --mount type=bind,src="$(pwd)",target=/app/lumyn -e KUBECONFIG=/app/lumyn/config -it itbench-sre-agent /bin/bash
   
   # Linux
   docker run --network=host --mount type=bind,src="$(pwd)",target=/app/lumyn -e KUBECONFIG=/app/lumyn/config -it itbench-sre-agent /bin/bash
   ```

6. **Get the observability URL**
   
   Inside the docker container, run:
   ```bash
   kubectl get ingress -n prometheus
   ```
   
   You should see output like:
   ```
   NAME         CLASS   HOSTS   ADDRESS                                                                   PORTS   AGE
   prometheus   nginx   *       ad54bc930b7ec40c38f06be1a1ed0758-1859094179.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com   80      10h
   ```
   
   Copy the content under the `ADDRESS` section. This is your `<observability-url>`.

7. **Update environment variables**
   
   Open the `.env` file in a text editor and update the following values:
   - `API_KEY_AGENTS`: Your provided API key
   - `API_KEY_TOOLS`: Your provided API key  
   - `OBSERVABILITY_STACK_URL`: `http://<observability-url>`
   - `TOPOLOGY_URL`: `http://<observability-url>/topology`

8. **Start the agent**
   ```bash
   crewai run
   ```
